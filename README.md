# Loan-Status-Prediction

Objective: Predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on applicant features.

Machine Learning Models Used:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Dependencies:

Dependencies:

pandas: A popular library for data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: A library for numerical operations on arrays and matrices.
matplotlib: A library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
seaborn: A data visualization library based on matplotlib that provides an interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
Dataset: The project uses a dataset containing various features of loan applicants, such as gender, marital status, education, income, and more. This dataset is likely used for training and evaluating the machine learning models.

Project Flow: The project likely follows these general steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, exploring, and preparing the dataset for modeling.
Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features and transforming data if needed.
Model Selection: Choosing the Logistic Regression and Random Forest models for prediction.
Model Training: Training these models on the prepared dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, etc.).
